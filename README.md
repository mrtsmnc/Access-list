# Access-list
:(Access Control List) is a mechanism used to control incoming or outgoing traffic on network devices (such as routers, switches, firewalls, etc.). ACLs are used to filter traffic entering or exiting a specific network based on specific criteria, in order to control which devices in a network can access which resources. ACLs typically control traffic based on certain criteria such as IP address, protocol type, source port, and destination port. For example, only allowing devices in a specific network to access the internet through a specific port while blocking all other ports. Properly configuring ACLs is important for controlling traffic between devices on a network and increasing security.
